# The Odin Project - Etch-A-Sketch

## Project Description

The project is to create a simple browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch using the basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts learned in the Foundations Course at The Odin Project.

## Learning Objectives

The objective is to apply foundational HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and practice problem-solving and researching skills, and, when the code isn't running as intended, to figure out and understand why it doesn't.
